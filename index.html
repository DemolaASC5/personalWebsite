        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>My name is Demola Ogunnaike and I'm currently a senior at Medgar Evers College Preparatory School in Brooklyn, New York. I enjoy physics, mathematics, Chinese, playing basketball and soccer, and coding. I hope to attend MIT in the fall of 2019 and become a mechanical engineer. </p>

            <h2>Chess</h2>
            <p> I've been playing chess for 5 years at Medgar Evers College Preparatory School. Initially, I was a terrible player, losing several games in tournaments and at the chess club at my school. However, I stayed dedicated to learning chess in desire of getting better. Eventually, I improved as I won several medals and trophies in Chess In the School tournaments. I also became Vice-President and President of my chess team and lead them to several first place trophies. Recently, I lead my team at the National High School Chess Championship in Columbus, Ohio to an 11th place finish in the under 1200 section. Challenge me to a match on chess.com</p>
